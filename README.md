# Digital Obsidian Garden
Hello! This is a github repository that stores my obsidian notes and deploys them to a website. The deployed website can be found at [https://vanilla-digital-garden.vercel.app/](https://vanilla-digital-garden.vercel.app/)

This website was made using [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). I highly recommend checking this out!
