# HTML
- Stands for HyperText Markup Language
- Defines the structure and pure content of the website
- Relies on [[CSS\|CSS]] and [[Javascript\|Javascript]] to stylize content
## Structure
- HTML needs to be declared first with `<!Doctype HTML>`
- A lot of HTML syntax relies on nesting and wrapping. For instance, the syntax to write a paragraph is: 
`<p> Content Here </p>`

```ad-info
Some tags do not adhere to this rule, as for instance the tag `<br>` is considered a *Void Element*, and thus does not ned a closing tag
```
