# Hello There!

I'm [AuditeVoez](https://github.com/AuditeVoez), a Computer Science Student at the University of San Carlos! I aspire to be a full-stack developer with experience in making websites work efficiently and beautifully!

# Why Vanilla Garden?

This website was conceived with Vanilla(Nekopara)'s theme in mind. Then, since this project was deployed with the help of the [Digital Garden plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden), I decided to add the "garden" part alongside it.

# What's the purpose of this website?

Well, the main reason why I deployed this website is to share my code to my friends, and that's about it.

```ad-attention
This website is not affiliated, associated, authorized, or officially connected with Nekoworks and its subsidiaries. This site is merely inspired by Nekopara.
```
# Why is there a gif of Vanilla from Nekopara right below?

Because she's cute, that's all.
